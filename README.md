# DISC Personality Assessment Tool

## Overview

This Streamlit-based application serves as an interactive form for analyzing individuals' personality types based on the DISC assessment method. Users answer a series of questions, and their responses are scored and categorized into DISC dimensions. The tool is designed to replace traditional hand-drawing methods with a digital solution that includes graphical representations of assessment results.

## Features

- **Graphical Results**: Upon completion, participants receive a graph visualizing their scores in each DISC category, making it easier to analyze personality traits.
- **Email Integration**: Detailed results, including graphical representations, are automatically emailed to the customer, providing a record of each assessment.
